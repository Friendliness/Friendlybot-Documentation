You can create a button or several buttons, which can be clicked by users to create a ticket. When someone clicks the button, a channel will be created and the configured role(s) will be mentioned to alert them a new ticket is available. Once a ticket is created, a new message will also appear in the logchannel which shows who created the ticket, when they did so and what the channel is. The ticket can be closed by clicking the Close Ticket button. This will remove the user who created the ticket from their ticket, while still keeping it opened for staff to see. When a ticket is closed, a message will also be sent to the logchannel to show who closed the ticket. The ticket can be removed completely by clicking the Delete Ticket button. This will create a transcript of all of the messages that were sent in the ticket, and pass it on to the logchannel along with who deleted the ticket. The ability to customise the tickets is based on your Patreon tier. All of the limitations are also per server , for example if you have a limit of 3 buttons, this means you can create 3 buttons in every server, given you have the correct permissions.
